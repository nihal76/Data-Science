Welcome to the Data-Science wiki!

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices). NumPy provides a variety of tools that work quickly on arrays, allowing for math, logic, reshaping, sorting, choosing elements, input/output, Fourier transforms, basic math with matrices, stats, random simulations, and more. 

Scientific packages typically contain a variety of tools and functions that cater to scientific computing needs:

Mathematical Operations: Functions for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, etc.
Data Structures: Specialized structures like arrays, matrices, and data frames for efficient data handling.
Statistical Tools: Functions for statistical analysis, including mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Linear Algebra: Operations for matrix manipulation, solving linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
Plotting and Visualization: Tools for creating graphs, charts, and visual representations of data.

Numpy vs Python sequence

**Time:** NumPy arrays generally offer faster computations due to their optimized as its written in C language
This means they're designed to run as fast and efficiently as possible. C is known for its speed and closeness to hardware, making it an optimal choice for performance-critical operation
